        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin the dough, we need to proof the yeast. Place the water, sugar, and yeast into a bowl for it to activate and consume the sugars. Leave it for a handful of minutes for the process to continue.
</p>

    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the flour, Doritos, and salt to the water. Mix to a smooth texture. This is so much easier with a stand mixer, but you could just go for it if you truly wanted. Let rise for 10 minutes, allowing the dough to expand. Refrigerate after until ready to prepare.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To begin making the sauce, pour the olive oil into a non-stick pan over medium heat. Put the garlic and shallot into the pan, let them soften in the oil. Put in the beautiful tomatoes, careful not to splash some of the juice on me. Ah! Oh, it's alright. I need to wash this shirt anyways. Do you mind if I take it off? I don't necessarily want it getting worse. That's so much better. Now be a little more careful where you're swinging that thing. But really, keep stirring it and add in the tomato paste, oregano, and anise seed. Can't you smell how good that is? I love oregano. Use it in almost every dish. There's just something about that aroma. It hooks me everytime. Do you like it? That's a great choice, but I'm not biased, right? Haha. Let's add just a little bit of water, it's looking a little thicker than I anticipated and we need to stew all that together. It just wouldn't work without it! Now just careful. No! Look I am being careful. Besides you ran away. I'm not going to splash you. It's fine. I poured it in. Now come back, please. Oh no, I forgot to turn on the oven. I think it's 400. Can you please go into that cupboard and grab me that round stone? Perfect, thank you. I love this stone. Got it 15 years ago from my grandma. It's been in the family for decades I'm sure. So while we let that stew, we need to make sure not to snack on that too much. Hey! Promise that's the last one? Ok good. Now we need to mix the Camembert de Normandie and the Jamon Iberico de bellota into the sauce, just so it blends together, maybe melt the cheese a little bit. Yes, I know it's kind of pretenious but I promise it's going to be so good. We don't want this to get too gooey, though. Since we're just making the sauce now, it only has to be warm at most. The actual cooking happens later. Anything we don't use we can put in the fridge. Want to give this a taste? See if it needs salt or pepper? Perfect? I think it needs a little of both pepper. Do you mind? I know it's my recipe but I don't want to be ignorant of my guest.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Prepare the dough by dividing it into palm sized balls. Flatten the dough to about a 6 millimetre thickness and form into a circle. Spread the tomato sauce mixture along one half of the dough, leaving about a 20 millimetre gap from the edge. When full, take the half without filling and drape it over top, fully enveloping the other half. Press down on the edges to crimp the dough. This can also be done with a fork. Cut a couple vents into the Pizza Pop and brush with some olive oil.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Place the Pizza Pops onto the pizza stone. These will need about 15-20 minutes. In the meantime, it's time to start the reduction. Pour the Monster into a small saucepot and bring to a boil. Add the Cheez-Its to the boiling Monster and reduce the mixture. If necessary, you can add a corn starch slurry, but be careful about overthickening it. When at the desired consistency, strain through a fine sieve and let cool.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Pull them out when cooked fully and let them cool for 5 minutes before eating. Drizzle the reduction onto the Pizza Pops or use it as a dip.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Have the ice cream sit in room temperature for about 5 minutes, until the ice cream is malleable but not melted.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Spread the ice cream gently using a spoon or butter knife. It's likely you won't use the whole tub with amount, but it's better to have too much than too little. Remember, these calories won't count, right buddy?</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Place another cookie on top of the ice cream. Repeat until all the cookies have been used up. Glad you did this with me bruh.</p>
